# 📍 Campus map as an extension of MyTimetable (more like a building map)

#### 🗾 Rationale

Hard to navigate buildings with only a room code and signs and the inaccuracy of Google maps. No accessibility information.

#### 👨‍💻 Software

shows where buildings are, as well as where in the building the room is located, displays which entrances are closest to a room, displays which doors lead to which rooms

#### 🔝 Possible extension

allow other organisations to add in their buildings and floor plans
